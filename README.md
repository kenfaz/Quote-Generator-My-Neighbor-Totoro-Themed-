# Quote-Generator-My-Neighbor-Totoro-Themed-
Decided to hid the wallpaper, since the wallpaper might be unstable to some devices with unusual screen aspect ratios. 


## My Neighbor Totoro | となりのトトロ | (runs on wallpaper engine)
This is a Web Based wallpaper created using **HTML***, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This wallpaper has a quote generator produced by using a quote generator **API**. Originally, I started this project with the intention of creating an ~~anime quote generator~~, but I couldn't find any **API** for it, some were *discontinued* and *deprecated*.

I decided to center the theme to the anime **"My Neighbor Totoro"** by *Hayao Miyazaki*. Just because it's cute. I hope you guys will like this.

### Wallpaper Description
This wallpaper uses an open-source **API** to retrieve random quotes => "https://api.quotable.io/random". Since this involves retrieving data online, internet connectivity is a must and problems may occur if you have no internet connection! Also an aspect ratio of **16 | 9 (1920 x 1080 minimum)** is recommended or else there might be problems, I'm not sure tho :<.

This also has a **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode** toggle to switch themes based on your preference.

This is my first time creating a **Web Based wallpaper**, so If you see anything weird or if there is a problem or if the wallpaper does not match what is shown in the preview video above and you think it is a problem then you can tell me so I can fix it.

### Credits
Artworks: Most of the artworks came from Studio Ghibli that I found online.
