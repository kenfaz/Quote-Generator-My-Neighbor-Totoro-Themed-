	"description" : "[h1]My Neighbor Totoro | となりのトトロ |[/h1]\nThis is a Web Based wallpaper created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This wallpaper has a quote generator produced by using a quote generator [b]API[/b]. Originally, I started this project with the intention of creating an anime quote generator, but I couldn't find any API for it, some were discontinued and deprecated.\n\nI decided to center the theme to the anime \"My Neighbor Totoro\" by \tHayao Miyazaki. Just because it's cute. I hope you guys will like this. This is also my first time creating a Web Based wallpaper, so If you see anything weird or if there is a problem, don't hesitate to tell me.\n\n[h2]Wallpaper Description[/h2]\nThis wallpaper uses an open-source [b]API[/b] to retrieve random quotes => \"https://api.quotable.io/random\". Since this involves retrieving data online, internet connectivity is a must and problems may occur if you have no internet connection! Also an aspect ratio of [b]16 | 9 (1920 x 1080 minimum)[/b] is recommended or else there [b]might[/b] be problems I'm not sure tho :<. \n\nThis also has a [b]Dark Mode[/b] and [b]Light Mode[/b] toggle to switch themes based on your preference.\n\nIf the wallpaper does not match what is shown in the preview video above and you think it is a problem then you can tell me so I can fix it.\n\n[h3]Credits[/h3]\n[b]Artworks:[/b] Most of the artworks came from [b]Studio Ghibli[/b] that I found online.\n[b]Font:[/b] https://www.dafont.com/nuku-nuku.font",
